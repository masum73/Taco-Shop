 1. HTML tags of index page ( figure, figcaption, article, aside, details, summary, hr and many more)
 2. HTML tags of hours page ( dl, dt, dd)
 3. HTML tags of Contact page ( form, fieldset, legend, address, a href="tel:+555555555" and many more)
 4. Used https://emojipedia.org/ for emojis in html page.
